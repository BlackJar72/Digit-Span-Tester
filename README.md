# Digit Span Tester

This is an old and dead / discontinued project from several years ago.  I don't plan to update this.  The reason it is here is for sharing purposes -- in case anyone, for whatever reason, would like to fork the project to add features they need of fix problems they have.  That is it.  I have not worked on this in years, and do not plan to start again.  This was actually a learning project, and only the second GUI / desktop app I ever made; I thought back to may days as a student and imagined something that might have been useful in a lab I was in and made it.  My lack of experience at the time should be a warning, I didn't really know what I was doing, and this can be very buggy and the code is kind of a mess.

The code is not the cleanest as I was far less skiled at the time, and the sound system is kind of a mess (and breaks under Linux, and possibly other *nix variant such as Mac, maybe even under newer versions of Windows); it worked find for me in Windows XP.

This was created to perform automated digit span tests to evaluate on working memory function, especially in cognitive / neuro research. I hope to reduce practice effects and eliminate the need to use clinical assessments in research settings. Requires Java 7 or newer. Note that this is a research tool, and was not intended (and not evaluated) for clinical assessment.

FINAL VERSION: If you want more features, download the source and hack it yourself.

Ethics Note: Since this does not diagnose anything, label results as normal/abnormal, contain pre-made stimuli or anything from a published assessment, and neither tries to teach the task nor seems to do so (as some commercial products claim to do) I believe it is safe and acceptable in the public domain. (If this were not true, it wouldn't be here.)
