# Digit Span Tester

This is an old and dead / discontinued project from several years ago.  It will not be updated, I do not plan to deal with issues.  The reason it is here is for sharing purposes -- in case anyone, for whatever reason, would like to fork the project to add features they need of fix problems they have.  That is it.  I have not worked on this in years, and do not plan to start again.

The code is not the cleanest as I was far less skiled at the time, and the sound system is kind of a mess (and breaks under Linux, and possibly other *nix variant such as Mac), but everything seemed to work fine for me under Windows.

Binary jars, zipped versions of the source, and older versions can be found at:

This was created to perform automated digit span tests to evaluate on working memory function, especially in cognitive / neuro research. I hope to reduce practice effects and eliminate the need to use clinical assessments in research settings. Requires Java 7 or newer. Note that this is a research tool, and was not intended (and not evaluated) for clinical assessment.

FINAL VERSION: If you want more features, download the source and hack it yourself.

Ethics Note: Since this does not diagnose anything, label results as normal/abnormal, contain pre-made stimuli or anything from a published assessment, and neither tries to teach the task nor seems to do so (as some commercial products claim to do) I believe it is safe and acceptable in the public domain. (If this were not true, it wouldn't be here.)
